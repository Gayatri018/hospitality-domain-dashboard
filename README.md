# End-to-End Revenue Insights in Hospitality Domain

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to extract actionable insights from a hospitality domain dataset using Power BI. It provides end-to-end visibilityâ€”from data import and transformation to advanced DAX measures and an interactive dashboard. This enables stakeholders to monitor revenue performance, booking trends, cancellations, and occupancy.

## âœ… Steps Followed

1. **Imported Data**  
   Loaded the data folder containing all necessary files into Power BI.

2. **Data Transformation**  
   Cleaned and transformed raw data using **Power Query**â€”applied filters, renamed columns, fixed data types.

3. **DAX Columns & Measures**  
   After data load, used **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to:
   - Add calculated columns (e.g., Weekend/Weekday classification).
   - Create new measures for aggregation and KPIs.

4. **Data Modeling**  
   Created a **star schema** by establishing proper relationships among fact and dimension tables for optimal performance and data normalization.

5. **Dashboard Development**  
   Built an interactive dashboard using slicers, cards, charts, and visuals to present KPIs clearly and effectively.

## ðŸ“Š Key DAX Measures Created

- `Revenue = SUM('Table'[Revenue Realized])`
- `Total Bookings = COUNT('Table'[Booking ID])`
- `Total Capacity = SUM('Table'[Capacity])`
- `Total Successful Bookings`
- `Occupancy % = (Successful Bookings / Total Capacity) * 100`
- `Average Booking`
- `Number of Days in Data`
- `Total Cancellation Bookings`
- `Cancellation % = (Cancellations / Total Bookings) * 100`
- `Total Checked Out`
- ... and more
